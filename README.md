# Monte-Carlo-Method
Monte Carlo methods, or Monte Carlo experiments, are a broad class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling to obtain numerical results.

# Project Overview
This project aims to build a collection of interactive, animated visualizations that demonstrate the Monte Carlo method across various applications. Each visualization will be a standalone program, showcasing a different facet of this powerful computational technique, from estimating constants to simulating stochastic processes.
